A sophisticated real-time traffic management simulation system built in modern C++17. It models vehicle movement through a network of interconnected traffic nodes, supports multiple vehicle types with priority-based routing, and provides multiple simulation modes.

## Key Features

- **Multi-threaded Simulation**: Utilizes a custom thread pool for concurrent and efficient processing of traffic nodes.
- **Priority-based Vehicle Routing**: Emergency vehicles (ambulances, fire trucks) are given precedence over regular traffic.
- **Real-time Visualization**: Offers an ANSI color-coded terminal dashboard for monitoring the simulation.
- **Optimal Pathfinding**: Implements BFS to calculate the shortest path for vehicles.
- **Dynamic Capacity Management**: Nodes have capacity limits, and vehicles queue when a node is full.
- **Comprehensive Statistics**: Tracks and displays detailed performance metrics.
- **Modular & Modern Codebase**: Written in C++17 with a clean separation of concerns, smart pointers for memory management, and a custom thread pool.
